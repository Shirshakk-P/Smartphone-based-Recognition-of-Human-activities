=================================DATASET INFORMATION====================================

Dataset Characteristics:
1. Multi-Variate Data
2. Time Series Data

________________________________________________________________________________________
The experiments were carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years.
They performed a protocol of activities composed of six basic activities:
-3 static postures (standing, sitting, lying) 
-3 dynamic activities (walking, walking downstairs and walking upstairs). 

The experiment also included postural transitions that occurred between the static postures: 
1. stand-to-sit
2. sit-to-stand
3. sit-to-lie
4. lie-to-sit
5. stand-to-lie
6. lie-to-stand. 

All the participants were wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist during the experiment execution. 
Data capatured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz using the embedded accelerometer and gyroscope of the device. 
The experiments were video-recorded to label the data manually. 
The obtained dataset was randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). 
The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. 
The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of 561 features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

Attribute Information:

The dataset is then divided in two parts-

1. Inertial Sensor Data:
- Raw triaxial signals from the accelerometer and gyroscope of all the trials with with participants.
- The labels of all the performed activities.

2. Records of activity windows, composed of:
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.
- Its associated activity label.
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

Note:

- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the 'X' and 'y' files.
- The units used for the accelerations (total and body) are 'g'(gravity of earth-> 9.80665 m/seg2).
- The gyroscope units are rad/seg.
